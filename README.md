# Custom Newsletter subscription form for ConvertKit using Astro, React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS

This is a custom newsletter subscription form for ConvertKit that I built using Astro, React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. It's a simple form that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email address.

The tutorial for this project can be found on my blog here: [Custom Newsletter subscription form for ConvertKit using Astro, React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS](https://www.robcipolla.co.uk/blog/creating-a-newsletter-subscription-form-with-astro-react-and-convertkit)
